            <p>
I started playing football ate the age of 3 for my local team in Whitby, Western Suburbs.<br> I play in multiple positions with my best being Centre Attacking Midfield. <br> For my Wellington and National teams, I played right or left back and for school and seniors Striker, Winger or Centre Mid.

            <p>
For multiple years I played for the wellington federation team, competing in multiple national competitions, getting selected in the tournament team 2 out of 5 times. <br>
I participated in multiple NTC’s (national talent centres) from the age of 13-16 but could never get a solid grip and retain my place in the NTC squad which would’ve given me a shot of making the National Youth Teams (u17s and 19s).

            <p>
I started playing u15s at HIBS, got called up to first team in year 11 but refused to play due to having other football commitments (senior). I also didn’t play through year 12 because of this. <br> I came back in year 13 as it was my last year. after getting into a row with the coach I decided to play second team. <br> We made history by becoming first HIBS second team to play in division 2. Finished 2nd to last but had several good points including beating the HIBS first team in a tournament game. <br> I ended the season getting four awards being Player of the year, Players player of the year, Top goal scorer and Best Attitude.

After playing at wests for 12 years I decided to make the move to Tawa Football Club. Joining when I was 15 years old I got thrown straight into the first team setup but mainly playing with the reserves, I made 4 appearances for the 1st team that season playing in the top division in wellington. I am now in my fifth year at Tawa floating between the first and second team as we make a
